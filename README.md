## Introduction

This is an object-oriented implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow on CIFAR10 dataset. The CNN class could be initialized, trained, tested, saved, and loaded in a manner similar to Keras, which is highly human-readable, portable, and scalable. The classification accuracy on CIFAR10 dataset is 80%.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.5
* Numpy 1.14
* TensorFlow 1.8
* Matplotlib 2.1.1 (for demo purpose)


## Files
```bash
.
├── cifar.py
├── cnn.py
├── main.py
├── README.md
└── utils.py
```
## Features

* User-friendly CNN API wrapped
* Allows changing learning rate and dropout rate in real time
* No need for significant changes to codes in order to work for other tasks

## Usage

In Python, to build CNN classifier using the package in a Keras style:

```python
from cnn import CNN
model = CNN(input_size = input_size, num_classes = num_classes, optimizer = optimizer)
...
# Train on train set
    for i, idx in enumerate(mini_batch_idx):
        train_loss = model.train(data = x_train[idx], label = y_train_onehot[idx], learning_rate = learning_rate, dropout_rate = dropout_rate)
        if i % 200 == 0:
            train_prediction_onehot = model.test(data = x_train[idx])
            train_prediction = np.argmax(train_prediction_onehot, axis = 1).reshape((-1,1))
            train_accuracy = model_accuracy(label = y_train[idx], prediction = train_prediction)
            print('Training Loss: %f, Training Accuracy: %f' % (train_loss, train_accuracy))
```

## Demo

To test the CNN classifier on CIFAR10, simply run the following command in the shell:

```bash
$ python main.py --train --test --epoch 30 --lr_decay 0.9 --dropout 0.5
```

```

The final test accuracy is 79.4%. The running time of training for 30 epochs is less than 5 minutes on a PC using a NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X GPU.

## Future Work

Add TensorBoard functionalities to the CNN class.
